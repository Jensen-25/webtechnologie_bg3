This folder (WEBTECHNOLOGIE_BG3) contains the entire structure for the online website Fit 'n Flavors that sells protein products for users. A user can buy any of our 10 products and have them delivered once they are a registered user of the website. The code of the website is structured into conveniently named folders. These are very self-explanatory to navigate. Each folder contains one or more files which display the site to the user and one or more files that are used exclusively for server side manegament such as connections to the database, CSS files or Javascript files. There are a few files outside of folders. These are placed this way because they are essential for the entire server and not just one part of it. These files contain functionality that is contained in almost all other files. It also contains the homepage and this README file for obvious reasons. I hope the structure and code of this website is structured and commented well enough to be understood.
